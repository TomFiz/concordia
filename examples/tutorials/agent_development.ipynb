Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

Jack's parents had given them permission to take on the job to help them gain some independence and earn some extra money, and they threw themselves into the role, learning the ins and outs of the pub and developing a close friendship with the owner, who became a mentor to them. Jack loved the sense of community that came with working at the pub, and they enjoyed listening to the live music performances that took place there every week.  \n",

The experience was a highlight of their year, and Jack felt a deep sense of connection to the music and the people around them. As they danced and sang along to the songs, Jack felt a sense of freedom and joy that they had never experienced before, and it was a moment that stayed with them for a long time.\n",
