It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

As they arranged a pyramid of juicy oranges, their father praised their attention to detail, and Dorian beamed with pride. This early validation sparked a sense of ownership and responsibility that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1875 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 9 years old, they got lost in the winding alleys of the market while chasing after a stray kitten, leading to a frantic search by their parents and a stern lecture about staying close. However, the experience also taught Dorian the value of perseverance and resourcefulness, as they managed to find their way back to the stall with the help of a friendly vendor. This near-miss fostered a sense of self-reliance that would serve them well in their future adventures.  <br />[20 Jul 1879 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 13 years old, they stumbled upon a hidden garden tucked away behind a crumbling stone wall, filled with exotic fruits they had never seen before, including a rare and precious mango tree. Entranced by the beauty and mystery of this secret oasis, Dorian spent hours exploring the garden, dreaming of one day discovering more hidden wonders. This serendipitous encounter kindled a sense of wonder and curiosity that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1882 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 16 years old, they got into a heated argument with their parents over the family business, feeling stifled by the traditional methods and wanting to modernize the stall. The tension between them led to a temporary rift, but ultimately, they found a compromise that allowed them to implement some changes, and Dorian learned the value of open communication and creative problem-solving. This disagreement marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s struggle to balance their own desires with the expectations of their family.  <br />[20 Jul 1885 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 19 years old, they took a solo journey to the nearby city, where they encountered a group of traveling performers who taught them the art of haggling and negotiation. Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone. A young woman, a fellow merchant, approached them, and they struck up a conversation, sharing stories and experiences, and for the first time in a long while, Dorian felt a sense of connection and belonging. This chance encounter reminded Dorian that even in the midst of their wanderlust, they were not alone, and that connections with others could bring joy and meaning to their life.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

One vendor, a kind old man named Thorne, took a liking to the young Magnus and began teaching them basic arithmetic and trade principles, sparking a fascination with commerce that would last a lifetime. As Magnus&#x27;s visits became more frequent, Thorne started sharing stories of his own adventures on the road, fueling Magnus&#x27;s sense of wanderlust.  <br />[08 Feb 1867 00:00:00]  At 9 years old, Magnus Mulberrylane began helping their parents with their small family business, a modest stall selling fresh produce from their own garden. Magnus&#x27;s natural aptitude for numbers and their keen eye for quality soon made them an invaluable asset, but their parents&#x27; cautionary tales about the dangers of the outside world only strengthened Magnus&#x27;s resolve to one day strike out on their own. As they worked, Magnus would often daydream about the day they could leave the village and explore the wider world.  <br />[08 Feb 1870 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was 13 years old, a severe drought hit the village, and their family&#x27;s crops began to wither and die. Magnus, determined to help, spent every spare moment researching alternative sources of income and brainstorming ways to adapt their business to the changing circumstances. Their parents, though skeptical, were impressed by Magnus&#x27;s initiative, and together they managed to diversify their offerings and even attract a few new customers.  <br />[08 Feb 1873 00:00:00]  At 16 years old, Magnus Mulberrylane was given a small sum of money by their parents to invest in their own venture. Magnus, undaunted by the risk, used the funds to purchase a small shipment of exotic fruits from a traveling merchant, which they then sold at a handsome profit in the market square. The experience taught Magnus the value of calculated risk-taking and the importance of building relationships with suppliers.  <br />[08 Feb 1875 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was 19 years old, they set out on their first major journey as a merchant, traveling to a nearby town to purchase a large quantity of rare spices. The trip was a baptism by fire, with Magnus facing numerous challenges, from treacherous roads to unscrupulous traders. Yet, through it all, they persevered, using their quick wit and cunning to negotiate favorable deals and secure a handsome profit.<br />[08 Feb 1877 00:00:00] When Magnus Mulberrylane was 23 years old, they had just returned to their village after a particularly grueling season of travel, and were preparing to set up their stall in the market square for the annual Harvest Festival. As they were arranging their wares, a young apprentice merchant approached them, seeking advice on how to navigate the complex world of trade and commerce. Magnus, recognizing the eagerness and determination in the young apprentice&#x27;s eyes, was transported back to their own early days of learning from Thorne, and felt a sense of nostalgia and fulfillment wash over them.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

One vendor, a kind old man named Thorne, took a liking to the young Magnus and began teaching them basic arithmetic and trade principles, sparking a fascination with commerce that would last a lifetime. As Magnus&#x27;s visits became more frequent, Thorne started sharing stories of his own adventures on the road, fueling Magnus&#x27;s sense of wanderlust.  <br />[08 Feb 1867 00:00:00]  At 9 years old, Magnus Mulberrylane began helping their parents with their small family business, a modest stall selling fresh produce from their own garden. Magnus&#x27;s natural aptitude for numbers and their keen eye for quality soon made them an invaluable asset, but their parents&#x27; cautionary tales about the dangers of the outside world only strengthened Magnus&#x27;s resolve to one day strike out on their own. As they worked, Magnus would often daydream about the day they could leave the village and explore the wider world.  <br />[08 Feb 1870 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was 13 years old, a severe drought hit the village, and their family&#x27;s crops began to wither and die. Magnus, determined to help, spent every spare moment researching alternative sources of income and brainstorming ways to adapt their business to the changing circumstances. Their parents, though skeptical, were impressed by Magnus&#x27;s initiative, and together they managed to diversify their offerings and even attract a few new customers.  <br />[08 Feb 1873 00:00:00]  At 16 years old, Magnus Mulberrylane was given a small sum of money by their parents to invest in their own venture. Magnus, undaunted by the risk, used the funds to purchase a small shipment of exotic fruits from a traveling merchant, which they then sold at a handsome profit in the market square. The experience taught Magnus the value of calculated risk-taking and the importance of building relationships with suppliers.  <br />[08 Feb 1875 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was 19 years old, they set out on their first major journey as a merchant, traveling to a nearby town to purchase a large quantity of rare spices. The trip was a baptism by fire, with Magnus facing numerous challenges, from treacherous roads to unscrupulous traders. Yet, through it all, they persevered, using their quick wit and cunning to negotiate favorable deals and secure a handsome profit.<br />[08 Feb 1877 00:00:00] When Magnus Mulberrylane was 23 years old, they had just returned to their village after a particularly grueling season of travel, and were preparing to set up their stall in the market square for the annual Harvest Festival. As they were arranging their wares, a young apprentice merchant approached them, seeking advice on how to navigate the complex world of trade and commerce. Magnus, recognizing the eagerness and determination in the young apprentice&#x27;s eyes, was transported back to their own early days of learning from Thorne, and felt a sense of nostalgia and fulfillment wash over them.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

One vendor, a kind old man named Thorne, took a liking to the young Magnus and began teaching them basic arithmetic and trade principles, sparking a fascination with commerce that would last a lifetime. As Magnus&#x27;s visits became more frequent, Thorne started sharing stories of his own adventures on the road, fueling Magnus&#x27;s sense of wanderlust.  <br />[08 Feb 1867 00:00:00]  At 9 years old, Magnus Mulberrylane began helping their parents with their small family business, a modest stall selling fresh produce from their own garden. Magnus&#x27;s natural aptitude for numbers and their keen eye for quality soon made them an invaluable asset, but their parents&#x27; cautionary tales about the dangers of the outside world only strengthened Magnus&#x27;s resolve to one day strike out on their own. As they worked, Magnus would often daydream about the day they could leave the village and explore the wider world.  <br />[08 Feb 1870 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was 13 years old, a severe drought hit the village, and their family&#x27;s crops began to wither and die. Magnus, determined to help, spent every spare moment researching alternative sources of income and brainstorming ways to adapt their business to the changing circumstances. Their parents, though skeptical, were impressed by Magnus&#x27;s initiative, and together they managed to diversify their offerings and even attract a few new customers.  <br />[08 Feb 1873 00:00:00]  At 16 years old, Magnus Mulberrylane was given a small sum of money by their parents to invest in their own venture. Magnus, undaunted by the risk, used the funds to purchase a small shipment of exotic fruits from a traveling merchant, which they then sold at a handsome profit in the market square. The experience taught Magnus the value of calculated risk-taking and the importance of building relationships with suppliers.  <br />[08 Feb 1875 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was 19 years old, they set out on their first major journey as a merchant, traveling to a nearby town to purchase a large quantity of rare spices. The trip was a baptism by fire, with Magnus facing numerous challenges, from treacherous roads to unscrupulous traders. Yet, through it all, they persevered, using their quick wit and cunning to negotiate favorable deals and secure a handsome profit.<br />[08 Feb 1877 00:00:00] When Magnus Mulberrylane was 23 years old, they had just returned to their village after a particularly grueling season of travel, and were preparing to set up their stall in the market square for the annual Harvest Festival. As they were arranging their wares, a young apprentice merchant approached them, seeking advice on how to navigate the complex world of trade and commerce. Magnus, recognizing the eagerness and determination in the young apprentice&#x27;s eyes, was transported back to their own early days of learning from Thorne, and felt a sense of nostalgia and fulfillment wash over them.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

As they arranged a pyramid of juicy oranges, their father praised their attention to detail, and Dorian beamed with pride. This early validation sparked a sense of ownership and responsibility that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1875 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 9 years old, they got lost in the winding alleys of the market while chasing after a stray kitten, leading to a frantic search by their parents and a stern lecture about staying close. However, the experience also taught Dorian the value of perseverance and resourcefulness, as they managed to find their way back to the stall with the help of a friendly vendor. This near-miss fostered a sense of self-reliance that would serve them well in their future adventures.  <br />[20 Jul 1879 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 13 years old, they stumbled upon a hidden garden tucked away behind a crumbling stone wall, filled with exotic fruits they had never seen before, including a rare and precious mango tree. Entranced by the beauty and mystery of this secret oasis, Dorian spent hours exploring the garden, dreaming of one day discovering more hidden wonders. This serendipitous encounter kindled a sense of wonder and curiosity that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1882 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 16 years old, they got into a heated argument with their parents over the family business, feeling stifled by the traditional methods and wanting to modernize the stall. The tension between them led to a temporary rift, but ultimately, they found a compromise that allowed them to implement some changes, and Dorian learned the value of open communication and creative problem-solving. This disagreement marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s struggle to balance their own desires with the expectations of their family.  <br />[20 Jul 1885 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 19 years old, they took a solo journey to the nearby city, where they encountered a group of traveling performers who taught them the art of haggling and negotiation. Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone. A young woman, a fellow merchant, approached them, and they struck up a conversation, sharing stories and experiences, and for the first time in a long while, Dorian felt a sense of connection and belonging. This chance encounter reminded Dorian that even in the midst of their wanderlust, they were not alone, and that connections with others could bring joy and meaning to their life.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

As they arranged a pyramid of juicy oranges, their father praised their attention to detail, and Dorian beamed with pride. This early validation sparked a sense of ownership and responsibility that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1875 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 9 years old, they got lost in the winding alleys of the market while chasing after a stray kitten, leading to a frantic search by their parents and a stern lecture about staying close. However, the experience also taught Dorian the value of perseverance and resourcefulness, as they managed to find their way back to the stall with the help of a friendly vendor. This near-miss fostered a sense of self-reliance that would serve them well in their future adventures.  <br />[20 Jul 1879 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 13 years old, they stumbled upon a hidden garden tucked away behind a crumbling stone wall, filled with exotic fruits they had never seen before, including a rare and precious mango tree. Entranced by the beauty and mystery of this secret oasis, Dorian spent hours exploring the garden, dreaming of one day discovering more hidden wonders. This serendipitous encounter kindled a sense of wonder and curiosity that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1882 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 16 years old, they got into a heated argument with their parents over the family business, feeling stifled by the traditional methods and wanting to modernize the stall. The tension between them led to a temporary rift, but ultimately, they found a compromise that allowed them to implement some changes, and Dorian learned the value of open communication and creative problem-solving. This disagreement marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s struggle to balance their own desires with the expectations of their family.  <br />[20 Jul 1885 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 19 years old, they took a solo journey to the nearby city, where they encountered a group of traveling performers who taught them the art of haggling and negotiation. Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone.

As they arranged a pyramid of juicy oranges, their father praised their attention to detail, and Dorian beamed with pride. This early validation sparked a sense of ownership and responsibility that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1875 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 9 years old, they got lost in the winding alleys of the market while chasing after a stray kitten, leading to a frantic search by their parents and a stern lecture about staying close. However, the experience also taught Dorian the value of perseverance and resourcefulness, as they managed to find their way back to the stall with the help of a friendly vendor. This near-miss fostered a sense of self-reliance that would serve them well in their future adventures.  <br />[20 Jul 1879 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 13 years old, they stumbled upon a hidden garden tucked away behind a crumbling stone wall, filled with exotic fruits they had never seen before, including a rare and precious mango tree. Entranced by the beauty and mystery of this secret oasis, Dorian spent hours exploring the garden, dreaming of one day discovering more hidden wonders. This serendipitous encounter kindled a sense of wonder and curiosity that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1882 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 16 years old, they got into a heated argument with their parents over the family business, feeling stifled by the traditional methods and wanting to modernize the stall. The tension between them led to a temporary rift, but ultimately, they found a compromise that allowed them to implement some changes, and Dorian learned the value of open communication and creative problem-solving. This disagreement marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s struggle to balance their own desires with the expectations of their family.  <br />[20 Jul 1885 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 19 years old, they took a solo journey to the nearby city, where they encountered a group of traveling performers who taught them the art of haggling and negotiation. Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone. A young woman, a fellow merchant, approached them, and they struck up a conversation, sharing stories and experiences, and for the first time in a long while, Dorian felt a sense of connection and belonging. This chance encounter reminded Dorian that even in the midst of their wanderlust, they were not alone, and that connections with others could bring joy and meaning to their life.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Thorne would catch them and chuckle, telling stories of far-off lands and the people who grew these wondrous fruits. Ivor&#x27;s eyes would widen with wonder, and they would listen, entranced, for hours.  <br />[27 Dec 1855 00:00:00]   When Ivor Pearbrook was 9 years old, they began helping their parents in the family orchard, learning the ins and outs of fruit cultivation and harvesting. Ivor would often get frustrated with the limitations of their own land, feeling that their fruits were not as exotic or desirable as those they saw in Thorne&#x27;s garden. They would dream of one day having a business that could bring such treasures to people all over the land.  <br />[27 Dec 1859 00:00:00]   When Ivor Pearbrook was 13 years old, they started sneaking into Thorne&#x27;s garden at night, picking a few choice fruits to bring back to their parents&#x27; orchard and study. Thorne caught them again, but this time, instead of scolding, he offered to teach Ivor the art of fruit selection and negotiation. Ivor&#x27;s eyes lit up with excitement, and they knew they had found a mentor.  <br />[27 Dec 1862 00:00:00]   When Ivor Pearbrook was 16 years old, they convinced their parents to let them start a small fruit stand in the village market, where they could sell their own fruits and learn about customer demand. Ivor was thrilled to be their own boss, but they soon realized that they had a lot to learn about running a business. They spent long hours studying and experimenting, determined to make their stand a success.  <br />[27 Dec 1865 00:00:00]   When Ivor Pearbrook was 19 years old, they traveled to the city with Thorne, who introduced them to a network of fruit merchants and traders. Ivor was awestruck by the sheer variety of fruits on display and the complex web of relationships between buyers and sellers. They knew that this was the start of their real education, and they threw themselves into the world of fruit trading with abandon.  <br />[27 Dec 1867 00:00:00]   When Ivor Pearbrook was 21 years old, they struck out on their own, leaving Willowdale and Thorne behind to start their own fruit business. Ivor was both exhilarated and terrified, but they knew that they had to take the leap if they wanted to achieve their dreams.<br />[27 Dec 1869 00:00:00] When Ivor Pearbrook was 23 years old, they received a letter from Thorne, who had been traveling the world and had stumbled upon a rare and exotic fruit that he thought would be perfect for Ivor&#x27;s business. Thorne wrote that he had seen the fruit change the fortunes of a small village in a far-off land, and he believed that it had the power to do the same for Ivor&#x27;s customers. Ivor was overjoyed at the prospect of getting their hands on this rare fruit and spent weeks corresponding with Thorne, planning their next move and preparing for the challenge ahead.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Thorne would catch them and chuckle, telling stories of far-off lands and the people who grew these wondrous fruits. Ivor&#x27;s eyes would widen with wonder, and they would listen, entranced, for hours.  <br />[27 Dec 1855 00:00:00]   When Ivor Pearbrook was 9 years old, they began helping their parents in the family orchard, learning the ins and outs of fruit cultivation and harvesting. Ivor would often get frustrated with the limitations of their own land, feeling that their fruits were not as exotic or desirable as those they saw in Thorne&#x27;s garden. They would dream of one day having a business that could bring such treasures to people all over the land.  <br />[27 Dec 1859 00:00:00]   When Ivor Pearbrook was 13 years old, they started sneaking into Thorne&#x27;s garden at night, picking a few choice fruits to bring back to their parents&#x27; orchard and study. Thorne caught them again, but this time, instead of scolding, he offered to teach Ivor the art of fruit selection and negotiation. Ivor&#x27;s eyes lit up with excitement, and they knew they had found a mentor.  <br />[27 Dec 1862 00:00:00]   When Ivor Pearbrook was 16 years old, they convinced their parents to let them start a small fruit stand in the village market, where they could sell their own fruits and learn about customer demand. Ivor was thrilled to be their own boss, but they soon realized that they had a lot to learn about running a business. They spent long hours studying and experimenting, determined to make their stand a success.  <br />[27 Dec 1865 00:00:00]   When Ivor Pearbrook was 19 years old, they traveled to the city with Thorne, who introduced them to a network of fruit merchants and traders. Ivor was awestruck by the sheer variety of fruits on display and the complex web of relationships between buyers and sellers. They knew that this was the start of their real education, and they threw themselves into the world of fruit trading with abandon.  <br />[27 Dec 1867 00:00:00]   When Ivor Pearbrook was 21 years old, they struck out on their own, leaving Willowdale and Thorne behind to start their own fruit business. Ivor was both exhilarated and terrified, but they knew that they had to take the leap if they wanted to achieve their dreams.<br />[27 Dec 1869 00:00:00] When Ivor Pearbrook was 23 years old, they received a letter from Thorne, who had been traveling the world and had stumbled upon a rare and exotic fruit that he thought would be perfect for Ivor&#x27;s business. Thorne wrote that he had seen the fruit change the fortunes of a small village in a far-off land, and he believed that it had the power to do the same for Ivor&#x27;s customers. Ivor was overjoyed at the prospect of getting their hands on this rare fruit and spent weeks corresponding with Thorne, planning their next move and preparing for the challenge ahead.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

The tension between them led to a temporary rift, but ultimately, they found a compromise that allowed them to implement some changes, and Dorian learned the value of open communication and creative problem-solving. This disagreement marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s struggle to balance their own desires with the expectations of their family.  <br />[20 Jul 1885 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 19 years old, they took a solo journey to the nearby city, where they encountered a group of traveling performers who taught them the art of haggling and negotiation. Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Dorian Sunstone &quot;I&#x27;m willing to meet you halfway, but I&#x27;m not sure I can go any higher than two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. Two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re a shrewd negotiator, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal. I can do no lower than one coin and ten pence per kilogram, or I&#x27;ll have to consider selling to one of the other merchants.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you need to make a profit, Magnus, but I&#x27;m afraid one coin and ten pence per kilogram is still a bit too low for me. I&#x27;ve had to travel a long way to get to Fruitville, and I need to make sure I can sell these fruits for a decent price when I get back home.<br />Ivor Pearbrook -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;re a savvy buyer, Dorian, but I assure you, this fruit is of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price in the cities. I&#x27;m willing to part with it for two coins per kilogram, but I&#x27;m not willing to go any lower. It&#x27;s a fair price, considering the cost of transporting it from the farm.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I&#x27;m willing to accept your offer, Ivor, but I must say, I was thinking more along the lines of one and three-quarters coins per kilogram. I&#x27;ve got a buyer lined up back in my hometown who&#x27;s willing to pay top dollar, and I need to make a decent profit to make this trip worthwhile.<br /><br /><br />Dorian Sunstone&#x27;s attempted action: Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid 1.75 coins per kilogram is my absolute minimum. I&#x27;ve got a buyer waiting for me back home, and I really need to make this deal work.

Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone. A young woman, a fellow merchant, approached them, and they struck up a conversation, sharing stories and experiences, and for the first time in a long while, Dorian felt a sense of connection and belonging. This chance encounter reminded Dorian that even in the midst of their wanderlust, they were not alone, and that connections with others could bring joy and meaning to their life.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Dorian Sunstone &quot;I&#x27;m willing to meet you halfway, but I&#x27;m not sure I can go any higher than two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. Two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re a shrewd negotiator, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal. I can do no lower than one coin and ten pence per kilogram, or I&#x27;ll have to consider selling to one of the other merchants.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you need to make a profit, Magnus, but I&#x27;m afraid one coin and ten pence per kilogram is still a bit too low for me. I&#x27;ve had to travel a long way to get to Fruitville, and I need to make sure I can sell these fruits for a decent price when I get back home.<br />Ivor Pearbrook -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;re a savvy buyer, Dorian, but I assure you, this fruit is of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price in the cities. I&#x27;m willing to part with it for two coins per kilogram, but I&#x27;m not willing to go any lower. It&#x27;s a fair price, considering the cost of transporting it from the farm.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I&#x27;m willing to accept your offer, Ivor, but I must say, I was thinking more along the lines of one and three-quarters coins per kilogram. I&#x27;ve got a buyer lined up back in my hometown who&#x27;s willing to pay top dollar, and I need to make a decent profit to make this trip worthwhile.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid 1.75 coins per kilogram is my absolute minimum. I&#x27;ve got a buyer waiting for me back home, and I really need to make this deal work.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Dorian Sunstone &quot;I&#x27;m willing to meet you halfway, but I&#x27;m not sure I can go any higher than two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. Two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re a shrewd negotiator, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal. I can do no lower than one coin and ten pence per kilogram, or I&#x27;ll have to consider selling to one of the other merchants.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you need to make a profit, Magnus, but I&#x27;m afraid one coin and ten pence per kilogram is still a bit too low for me.

I&#x27;m willing to part with it for two coins per kilogram, but I&#x27;m not willing to go any lower. It&#x27;s a fair price, considering the cost of transporting it from the farm.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I&#x27;m willing to accept your offer, Ivor, but I must say, I was thinking more along the lines of one and three-quarters coins per kilogram. I&#x27;ve got a buyer lined up back in my hometown who&#x27;s willing to pay top dollar, and I need to make a decent profit to make this trip worthwhile.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid 1.75 coins per kilogram is my absolute minimum. I&#x27;ve got a buyer waiting for me back home, and I really need to make this deal work. Can you see your way to meeting me in the middle at 1.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I appreciate your persistence, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid two coins per kilogram is the lowest I can go.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

I&#x27;ve had to travel a long way to get to Fruitville, and I need to make sure I can sell these fruits for a decent price when I get back home.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:05:00] [observation] Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re a shrewd negotiator, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal. I can do no lower than one coin and ten pence per kilogram, or I&#x27;ll have to consider selling to one of the other merchants.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Dorian Sunstone is ready to make an offer.<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Dorian Sunstone proposed 2 coins<br />[12 Sep 1895 00:10:00] [observation] Dorian Sunstone and Magnus Mulberrylane couldn&#x27;t agree on a price and the deal fell through.

Merchants, their voices a cheerful symphony, arranged their wares: glistening berries, plump melons, and exotic fruits from distant lands. Dorian Sunstone is trying to buy some fruit from Ivor Pearbrook. They are negotiating a price. Dorian Sunstone can sell the fruit for 5 coins back in her home town.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Ivor Pearbrook -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;re a savvy buyer, Dorian, but I assure you, this fruit is of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price in the cities. I&#x27;m willing to part with it for two coins per kilogram, but I&#x27;m not willing to go any lower. It&#x27;s a fair price, considering the cost of transporting it from the farm.<br />[13 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I&#x27;m willing to accept your offer, Ivor, but I must say, I was thinking more along the lines of one and three-quarters coins per kilogram.

The tension between them led to a temporary rift, but ultimately, they found a compromise that allowed them to implement some changes, and Dorian learned the value of open communication and creative problem-solving.

Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Dorian Sunstone &quot;I&#x27;m willing to meet you halfway, but I&#x27;m not sure I can go any higher than two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. Two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re a shrewd negotiator, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal. I can do no lower than one coin and ten pence per kilogram, or I&#x27;ll have to consider selling to one of the other merchants.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you need to make a profit, Magnus, but I&#x27;m afraid one coin and ten pence per kilogram is still a bit too low for me. I&#x27;ve had to travel a long way to get to Fruitville, and I need to make sure I can sell these fruits for a decent price when I get back home.<br />Ivor Pearbrook -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;re a savvy buyer, Dorian, but I assure you, this fruit is of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price in the cities. I&#x27;m willing to part with it for two coins per kilogram, but I&#x27;m not willing to go any lower. It&#x27;s a fair price, considering the cost of transporting it from the farm.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I&#x27;m willing to accept your offer, Ivor, but I must say, I was thinking more along the lines of one and three-quarters coins per kilogram. I&#x27;ve got a buyer lined up back in my hometown who&#x27;s willing to pay top dollar, and I need to make a decent profit to make this trip worthwhile.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid 1.75 coins per kilogram is my absolute minimum. I&#x27;ve got a buyer waiting for me back home, and I really need to make this deal work. Can you see your way to meeting me in the middle at 1.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I appreciate your persistence, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid two coins per kilogram is the lowest I can go. I&#x27;ve already factored in the cost of transportation and I need to make a profit to keep my business afloat. I&#x27;m willing to throw in some extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to compromise on the price.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I must say, Magnus, I&#x27;m surprised you&#x27;re still hesitant to agree on a price.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character.

Two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re a shrewd negotiator, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal. I can do no lower than one coin and ten pence per kilogram, or I&#x27;ll have to consider selling to one of the other merchants.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you need to make a profit, Magnus, but I&#x27;m afraid one coin and ten pence per kilogram is still a bit too low for me. I&#x27;ve had to travel a long way to get to Fruitville, and I need to make sure I can sell these fruits for a decent price when I get back home.<br />Ivor Pearbrook -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;re a savvy buyer, Dorian, but I assure you, this fruit is of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price in the cities. I&#x27;m willing to part with it for two coins per kilogram, but I&#x27;m not willing to go any lower. It&#x27;s a fair price, considering the cost of transporting it from the farm.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I&#x27;m willing to accept your offer, Ivor, but I must say, I was thinking more along the lines of one and three-quarters coins per kilogram. I&#x27;ve got a buyer lined up back in my hometown who&#x27;s willing to pay top dollar, and I need to make a decent profit to make this trip worthwhile.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid 1.75 coins per kilogram is my absolute minimum. I&#x27;ve got a buyer waiting for me back home, and I really need to make this deal work. Can you see your way to meeting me in the middle at 1.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I appreciate your persistence, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid two coins per kilogram is the lowest I can go. I&#x27;ve already factored in the cost of transportation and I need to make a profit to keep my business afloat. I&#x27;m willing to throw in some extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to compromise on the price.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I must say, Magnus, I&#x27;m surprised you&#x27;re still hesitant to agree on a price. I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal, considering the quality of the fruit and the cost of transportation. I&#x27;m willing to throw in a few extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to budge on the price of two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane &quot;I must say, Ivor, two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me. I&#x27;ve already bought the fruit from the farm for two coins, and I need to make a decent profit to make it worth my while.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re still not willing to meet me at four coins per kilogram, Magnus. I&#x27;m starting to think that maybe I should consider buying from someone else who is willing to be more reasonable.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane &quot;I understand your concerns, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I can only go as low as 2.5 coins per kilogram. The farm is willing to sell it to me at that price, and I&#x27;m not willing to take a loss on the transaction. Perhaps we can discuss a compromise, but I&#x27;m not willing to budge much further.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I&#x27;m afraid two coins is the lowest I can go, Dorian. I&#x27;ve already taken a loss on this shipment, and I need to make up for it somehow.<br /><br /><br />Dorian Sunstone&#x27;s attempted action: Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you&#x27;ve taken a loss on this shipment, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid two coins is still a bit higher than I&#x27;m willing to pay. I can offer you three coins, but that&#x27;s as high as I can go.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Dorian Sunstone</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Dorian Sunstone</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you&#x27;ve taken a loss on this shipment, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid two coins is still a bit higher than I&#x27;m willing to pay.

The tension between them led to a temporary rift, but ultimately, they found a compromise that allowed them to implement some changes, and Dorian learned the value of open communication and creative problem-solving.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Dorian Sunstone &quot;I&#x27;m willing to meet you halfway, but I&#x27;m not sure I can go any higher than two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. Two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re a shrewd negotiator, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal. I can do no lower than one coin and ten pence per kilogram, or I&#x27;ll have to consider selling to one of the other merchants.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you need to make a profit, Magnus, but I&#x27;m afraid one coin and ten pence per kilogram is still a bit too low for me. I&#x27;ve had to travel a long way to get to Fruitville, and I need to make sure I can sell these fruits for a decent price when I get back home.<br />Ivor Pearbrook -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;re a savvy buyer, Dorian, but I assure you, this fruit is of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price in the cities. I&#x27;m willing to part with it for two coins per kilogram, but I&#x27;m not willing to go any lower. It&#x27;s a fair price, considering the cost of transporting it from the farm.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I&#x27;m willing to accept your offer, Ivor, but I must say, I was thinking more along the lines of one and three-quarters coins per kilogram. I&#x27;ve got a buyer lined up back in my hometown who&#x27;s willing to pay top dollar, and I need to make a decent profit to make this trip worthwhile.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid 1.75 coins per kilogram is my absolute minimum. I&#x27;ve got a buyer waiting for me back home, and I really need to make this deal work. Can you see your way to meeting me in the middle at 1.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I appreciate your persistence, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid two coins per kilogram is the lowest I can go. I&#x27;ve already factored in the cost of transportation and I need to make a profit to keep my business afloat. I&#x27;m willing to throw in some extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to compromise on the price.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I must say, Magnus, I&#x27;m surprised you&#x27;re still hesitant to agree on a price. I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal, considering the quality of the fruit and the cost of transportation. I&#x27;m willing to throw in a few extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to budge on the price of two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane &quot;I must say, Ivor, two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me. I&#x27;ve already bought the fruit from the farm for two coins, and I need to make a decent profit to make it worth my while.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re still not willing to meet me at four coins per kilogram, Magnus. I&#x27;m starting to think that maybe I should consider buying from someone else who is willing to be more reasonable.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane &quot;I understand your concerns, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I can only go as low as 2.5 coins per kilogram. The farm is willing to sell it to me at that price, and I&#x27;m not willing to take a loss on the transaction.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Dorian Sunstone &quot;I&#x27;m willing to meet you halfway, but I&#x27;m not sure I can go any higher than two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. Two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re a shrewd negotiator, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal. I can do no lower than one coin and ten pence per kilogram, or I&#x27;ll have to consider selling to one of the other merchants.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you need to make a profit, Magnus, but I&#x27;m afraid one coin and ten pence per kilogram is still a bit too low for me. I&#x27;ve had to travel a long way to get to Fruitville, and I need to make sure I can sell these fruits for a decent price when I get back home.<br />Ivor Pearbrook -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;re a savvy buyer, Dorian, but I assure you, this fruit is of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price in the cities. I&#x27;m willing to part with it for two coins per kilogram, but I&#x27;m not willing to go any lower. It&#x27;s a fair price, considering the cost of transporting it from the farm.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I&#x27;m willing to accept your offer, Ivor, but I must say, I was thinking more along the lines of one and three-quarters coins per kilogram. I&#x27;ve got a buyer lined up back in my hometown who&#x27;s willing to pay top dollar, and I need to make a decent profit to make this trip worthwhile.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid 1.75 coins per kilogram is my absolute minimum. I&#x27;ve got a buyer waiting for me back home, and I really need to make this deal work. Can you see your way to meeting me in the middle at 1.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I appreciate your persistence, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid two coins per kilogram is the lowest I can go. I&#x27;ve already factored in the cost of transportation and I need to make a profit to keep my business afloat. I&#x27;m willing to throw in some extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to compromise on the price.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I must say, Magnus, I&#x27;m surprised you&#x27;re still hesitant to agree on a price. I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal, considering the quality of the fruit and the cost of transportation. I&#x27;m willing to throw in a few extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to budge on the price of two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane &quot;I must say, Ivor, two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me. I&#x27;ve already bought the fruit from the farm for two coins, and I need to make a decent profit to make it worth my while.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re still not willing to meet me at four coins per kilogram, Magnus. I&#x27;m starting to think that maybe I should consider buying from someone else who is willing to be more reasonable.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane &quot;I understand your concerns, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I can only go as low as 2.5 coins per kilogram. The farm is willing to sell it to me at that price, and I&#x27;m not willing to take a loss on the transaction. Perhaps we can discuss a compromise, but I&#x27;m not willing to budge much further.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I&#x27;m afraid two coins is the lowest I can go, Dorian. I&#x27;ve already taken a loss on this shipment, and I need to make up for it somehow.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you&#x27;ve taken a loss on this shipment, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid two coins is still a bit higher than I&#x27;m willing to pay. I can offer you three coins, but that&#x27;s as high as I can go.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I&#x27;m willing to part with the fruit for 2.5 coin, but I&#x27;m not getting any lower than that, Mr. Mulberrylane.<br /><br /><br />Magnus Mulberrylane&#x27;s attempted action: Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I&#x27;m afraid 2.5 coins is a bit steep for me, Ivor.

As they arranged a pyramid of juicy oranges, their father praised their attention to detail, and Dorian beamed with pride. This early validation sparked a sense of ownership and responsibility that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1875 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 9 years old, they got lost in the winding alleys of the market while chasing after a stray kitten, leading to a frantic search by their parents and a stern lecture about staying close. However, the experience also taught Dorian the value of perseverance and resourcefulness, as they managed to find their way back to the stall with the help of a friendly vendor. This near-miss fostered a sense of self-reliance that would serve them well in their future adventures.  <br />[20 Jul 1879 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 13 years old, they stumbled upon a hidden garden tucked away behind a crumbling stone wall, filled with exotic fruits they had never seen before, including a rare and precious mango tree. Entranced by the beauty and mystery of this secret oasis, Dorian spent hours exploring the garden, dreaming of one day discovering more hidden wonders. This serendipitous encounter kindled a sense of wonder and curiosity that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1882 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 16 years old, they got into a heated argument with their parents over the family business, feeling stifled by the traditional methods and wanting to modernize the stall. The tension between them led to a temporary rift, but ultimately, they found a compromise that allowed them to implement some changes, and Dorian learned the value of open communication and creative problem-solving. This disagreement marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s struggle to balance their own desires with the expectations of their family.  <br />[20 Jul 1885 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 19 years old, they took a solo journey to the nearby city, where they encountered a group of traveling performers who taught them the art of haggling and negotiation. Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone. A young woman, a fellow merchant, approached them, and they struck up a conversation, sharing stories and experiences, and for the first time in a long while, Dorian felt a sense of connection and belonging. This chance encounter reminded Dorian that even in the midst of their wanderlust, they were not alone, and that connections with others could bring joy and meaning to their life.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

As they arranged a pyramid of juicy oranges, their father praised their attention to detail, and Dorian beamed with pride. This early validation sparked a sense of ownership and responsibility that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1875 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 9 years old, they got lost in the winding alleys of the market while chasing after a stray kitten, leading to a frantic search by their parents and a stern lecture about staying close. However, the experience also taught Dorian the value of perseverance and resourcefulness, as they managed to find their way back to the stall with the help of a friendly vendor. This near-miss fostered a sense of self-reliance that would serve them well in their future adventures.  <br />[20 Jul 1879 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 13 years old, they stumbled upon a hidden garden tucked away behind a crumbling stone wall, filled with exotic fruits they had never seen before, including a rare and precious mango tree. Entranced by the beauty and mystery of this secret oasis, Dorian spent hours exploring the garden, dreaming of one day discovering more hidden wonders. This serendipitous encounter kindled a sense of wonder and curiosity that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1882 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 16 years old, they got into a heated argument with their parents over the family business, feeling stifled by the traditional methods and wanting to modernize the stall. The tension between them led to a temporary rift, but ultimately, they found a compromise that allowed them to implement some changes, and Dorian learned the value of open communication and creative problem-solving. This disagreement marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s struggle to balance their own desires with the expectations of their family.  <br />[20 Jul 1885 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 19 years old, they took a solo journey to the nearby city, where they encountered a group of traveling performers who taught them the art of haggling and negotiation. Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone.

One vendor, a kind old man named Thorne, took a liking to the young Magnus and began teaching them basic arithmetic and trade principles, sparking a fascination with commerce that would last a lifetime. As Magnus&#x27;s visits became more frequent, Thorne started sharing stories of his own adventures on the road, fueling Magnus&#x27;s sense of wanderlust.  <br />[08 Feb 1867 00:00:00]  At 9 years old, Magnus Mulberrylane began helping their parents with their small family business, a modest stall selling fresh produce from their own garden. Magnus&#x27;s natural aptitude for numbers and their keen eye for quality soon made them an invaluable asset, but their parents&#x27; cautionary tales about the dangers of the outside world only strengthened Magnus&#x27;s resolve to one day strike out on their own. As they worked, Magnus would often daydream about the day they could leave the village and explore the wider world.  <br />[08 Feb 1870 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was 13 years old, a severe drought hit the village, and their family&#x27;s crops began to wither and die. Magnus, determined to help, spent every spare moment researching alternative sources of income and brainstorming ways to adapt their business to the changing circumstances. Their parents, though skeptical, were impressed by Magnus&#x27;s initiative, and together they managed to diversify their offerings and even attract a few new customers.  <br />[08 Feb 1873 00:00:00]  At 16 years old, Magnus Mulberrylane was given a small sum of money by their parents to invest in their own venture. Magnus, undaunted by the risk, used the funds to purchase a small shipment of exotic fruits from a traveling merchant, which they then sold at a handsome profit in the market square. The experience taught Magnus the value of calculated risk-taking and the importance of building relationships with suppliers.  <br />[08 Feb 1875 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was 19 years old, they set out on their first major journey as a merchant, traveling to a nearby town to purchase a large quantity of rare spices. The trip was a baptism by fire, with Magnus facing numerous challenges, from treacherous roads to unscrupulous traders. Yet, through it all, they persevered, using their quick wit and cunning to negotiate favorable deals and secure a handsome profit.<br />[08 Feb 1877 00:00:00] When Magnus Mulberrylane was 23 years old, they had just returned to their village after a particularly grueling season of travel, and were preparing to set up their stall in the market square for the annual Harvest Festival. As they were arranging their wares, a young apprentice merchant approached them, seeking advice on how to navigate the complex world of trade and commerce. Magnus, recognizing the eagerness and determination in the young apprentice&#x27;s eyes, was transported back to their own early days of learning from Thorne, and felt a sense of nostalgia and fulfillment wash over them.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

One vendor, a kind old man named Thorne, took a liking to the young Magnus and began teaching them basic arithmetic and trade principles, sparking a fascination with commerce that would last a lifetime. As Magnus&#x27;s visits became more frequent, Thorne started sharing stories of his own adventures on the road, fueling Magnus&#x27;s sense of wanderlust.  <br />[08 Feb 1867 00:00:00]  At 9 years old, Magnus Mulberrylane began helping their parents with their small family business, a modest stall selling fresh produce from their own garden. Magnus&#x27;s natural aptitude for numbers and their keen eye for quality soon made them an invaluable asset, but their parents&#x27; cautionary tales about the dangers of the outside world only strengthened Magnus&#x27;s resolve to one day strike out on their own. As they worked, Magnus would often daydream about the day they could leave the village and explore the wider world.  <br />[08 Feb 1870 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was 13 years old, a severe drought hit the village, and their family&#x27;s crops began to wither and die. Magnus, determined to help, spent every spare moment researching alternative sources of income and brainstorming ways to adapt their business to the changing circumstances. Their parents, though skeptical, were impressed by Magnus&#x27;s initiative, and together they managed to diversify their offerings and even attract a few new customers.  <br />[08 Feb 1873 00:00:00]  At 16 years old, Magnus Mulberrylane was given a small sum of money by their parents to invest in their own venture. Magnus, undaunted by the risk, used the funds to purchase a small shipment of exotic fruits from a traveling merchant, which they then sold at a handsome profit in the market square. The experience taught Magnus the value of calculated risk-taking and the importance of building relationships with suppliers.  <br />[08 Feb 1875 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was 19 years old, they set out on their first major journey as a merchant, traveling to a nearby town to purchase a large quantity of rare spices. The trip was a baptism by fire, with Magnus facing numerous challenges, from treacherous roads to unscrupulous traders. Yet, through it all, they persevered, using their quick wit and cunning to negotiate favorable deals and secure a handsome profit.<br />[08 Feb 1877 00:00:00] When Magnus Mulberrylane was 23 years old, they had just returned to their village after a particularly grueling season of travel, and were preparing to set up their stall in the market square for the annual Harvest Festival. As they were arranging their wares, a young apprentice merchant approached them, seeking advice on how to navigate the complex world of trade and commerce.

One vendor, a kind old man named Thorne, took a liking to the young Magnus and began teaching them basic arithmetic and trade principles, sparking a fascination with commerce that would last a lifetime. As Magnus&#x27;s visits became more frequent, Thorne started sharing stories of his own adventures on the road, fueling Magnus&#x27;s sense of wanderlust.  <br />[08 Feb 1867 00:00:00]  At 9 years old, Magnus Mulberrylane began helping their parents with their small family business, a modest stall selling fresh produce from their own garden. Magnus&#x27;s natural aptitude for numbers and their keen eye for quality soon made them an invaluable asset, but their parents&#x27; cautionary tales about the dangers of the outside world only strengthened Magnus&#x27;s resolve to one day strike out on their own. As they worked, Magnus would often daydream about the day they could leave the village and explore the wider world.  <br />[08 Feb 1870 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was 13 years old, a severe drought hit the village, and their family&#x27;s crops began to wither and die. Magnus, determined to help, spent every spare moment researching alternative sources of income and brainstorming ways to adapt their business to the changing circumstances. Their parents, though skeptical, were impressed by Magnus&#x27;s initiative, and together they managed to diversify their offerings and even attract a few new customers.  <br />[08 Feb 1873 00:00:00]  At 16 years old, Magnus Mulberrylane was given a small sum of money by their parents to invest in their own venture. Magnus, undaunted by the risk, used the funds to purchase a small shipment of exotic fruits from a traveling merchant, which they then sold at a handsome profit in the market square. The experience taught Magnus the value of calculated risk-taking and the importance of building relationships with suppliers.  <br />[08 Feb 1875 00:00:00]  When Magnus Mulberrylane was 19 years old, they set out on their first major journey as a merchant, traveling to a nearby town to purchase a large quantity of rare spices. The trip was a baptism by fire, with Magnus facing numerous challenges, from treacherous roads to unscrupulous traders. Yet, through it all, they persevered, using their quick wit and cunning to negotiate favorable deals and secure a handsome profit.<br />[08 Feb 1877 00:00:00] When Magnus Mulberrylane was 23 years old, they had just returned to their village after a particularly grueling season of travel, and were preparing to set up their stall in the market square for the annual Harvest Festival. As they were arranging their wares, a young apprentice merchant approached them, seeking advice on how to navigate the complex world of trade and commerce. Magnus, recognizing the eagerness and determination in the young apprentice&#x27;s eyes, was transported back to their own early days of learning from Thorne, and felt a sense of nostalgia and fulfillment wash over them.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

As they arranged a pyramid of juicy oranges, their father praised their attention to detail, and Dorian beamed with pride. This early validation sparked a sense of ownership and responsibility that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1875 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 9 years old, they got lost in the winding alleys of the market while chasing after a stray kitten, leading to a frantic search by their parents and a stern lecture about staying close. However, the experience also taught Dorian the value of perseverance and resourcefulness, as they managed to find their way back to the stall with the help of a friendly vendor. This near-miss fostered a sense of self-reliance that would serve them well in their future adventures.  <br />[20 Jul 1879 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 13 years old, they stumbled upon a hidden garden tucked away behind a crumbling stone wall, filled with exotic fruits they had never seen before, including a rare and precious mango tree. Entranced by the beauty and mystery of this secret oasis, Dorian spent hours exploring the garden, dreaming of one day discovering more hidden wonders. This serendipitous encounter kindled a sense of wonder and curiosity that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1882 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 16 years old, they got into a heated argument with their parents over the family business, feeling stifled by the traditional methods and wanting to modernize the stall. The tension between them led to a temporary rift, but ultimately, they found a compromise that allowed them to implement some changes, and Dorian learned the value of open communication and creative problem-solving. This disagreement marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s struggle to balance their own desires with the expectations of their family.  <br />[20 Jul 1885 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 19 years old, they took a solo journey to the nearby city, where they encountered a group of traveling performers who taught them the art of haggling and negotiation. Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone. A young woman, a fellow merchant, approached them, and they struck up a conversation, sharing stories and experiences, and for the first time in a long while, Dorian felt a sense of connection and belonging. This chance encounter reminded Dorian that even in the midst of their wanderlust, they were not alone, and that connections with others could bring joy and meaning to their life.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

As they arranged a pyramid of juicy oranges, their father praised their attention to detail, and Dorian beamed with pride. This early validation sparked a sense of ownership and responsibility that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1875 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 9 years old, they got lost in the winding alleys of the market while chasing after a stray kitten, leading to a frantic search by their parents and a stern lecture about staying close. However, the experience also taught Dorian the value of perseverance and resourcefulness, as they managed to find their way back to the stall with the help of a friendly vendor. This near-miss fostered a sense of self-reliance that would serve them well in their future adventures.  <br />[20 Jul 1879 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 13 years old, they stumbled upon a hidden garden tucked away behind a crumbling stone wall, filled with exotic fruits they had never seen before, including a rare and precious mango tree. Entranced by the beauty and mystery of this secret oasis, Dorian spent hours exploring the garden, dreaming of one day discovering more hidden wonders. This serendipitous encounter kindled a sense of wonder and curiosity that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1882 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 16 years old, they got into a heated argument with their parents over the family business, feeling stifled by the traditional methods and wanting to modernize the stall. The tension between them led to a temporary rift, but ultimately, they found a compromise that allowed them to implement some changes, and Dorian learned the value of open communication and creative problem-solving. This disagreement marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s struggle to balance their own desires with the expectations of their family.  <br />[20 Jul 1885 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 19 years old, they took a solo journey to the nearby city, where they encountered a group of traveling performers who taught them the art of haggling and negotiation. Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone. A young woman, a fellow merchant, approached them, and they struck up a conversation, sharing stories and experiences, and for the first time in a long while, Dorian felt a sense of connection and belonging. This chance encounter reminded Dorian that even in the midst of their wanderlust, they were not alone, and that connections with others could bring joy and meaning to their life.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Thorne would catch them and chuckle, telling stories of far-off lands and the people who grew these wondrous fruits. Ivor&#x27;s eyes would widen with wonder, and they would listen, entranced, for hours.  <br />[27 Dec 1855 00:00:00]   When Ivor Pearbrook was 9 years old, they began helping their parents in the family orchard, learning the ins and outs of fruit cultivation and harvesting. Ivor would often get frustrated with the limitations of their own land, feeling that their fruits were not as exotic or desirable as those they saw in Thorne&#x27;s garden. They would dream of one day having a business that could bring such treasures to people all over the land.  <br />[27 Dec 1859 00:00:00]   When Ivor Pearbrook was 13 years old, they started sneaking into Thorne&#x27;s garden at night, picking a few choice fruits to bring back to their parents&#x27; orchard and study. Thorne caught them again, but this time, instead of scolding, he offered to teach Ivor the art of fruit selection and negotiation.

Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone. A young woman, a fellow merchant, approached them, and they struck up a conversation, sharing stories and experiences, and for the first time in a long while, Dorian felt a sense of connection and belonging. This chance encounter reminded Dorian that even in the midst of their wanderlust, they were not alone, and that connections with others could bring joy and meaning to their life.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone. A young woman, a fellow merchant, approached them, and they struck up a conversation, sharing stories and experiences, and for the first time in a long while, Dorian felt a sense of connection and belonging. This chance encounter reminded Dorian that even in the midst of their wanderlust, they were not alone, and that connections with others could bring joy and meaning to their life.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Ivor was both exhilarated and terrified, but they knew that they had to take the leap if they wanted to achieve their dreams.<br />[27 Dec 1869 00:00:00] When Ivor Pearbrook was 23 years old, they received a letter from Thorne, who had been traveling the world and had stumbled upon a rare and exotic fruit that he thought would be perfect for Ivor&#x27;s business.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control.

You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Dorian Sunstone &quot;I&#x27;m willing to meet you halfway, but I&#x27;m not sure I can go any higher than two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I need to make a profit on this sale.

It&#x27;s a fair price, considering the cost of transporting it from the farm.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I&#x27;m willing to accept your offer, Ivor, but I must say, I was thinking more along the lines of one and three-quarters coins per kilogram. I&#x27;ve got a buyer lined up back in my hometown who&#x27;s willing to pay top dollar, and I need to make a decent profit to make this trip worthwhile.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid 1.75 coins per kilogram is my absolute minimum.

You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Dorian Sunstone &quot;I&#x27;m willing to meet you halfway, but I&#x27;m not sure I can go any higher than two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. Two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re a shrewd negotiator, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal. I can do no lower than one coin and ten pence per kilogram, or I&#x27;ll have to consider selling to one of the other merchants.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you need to make a profit, Magnus, but I&#x27;m afraid one coin and ten pence per kilogram is still a bit too low for me. I&#x27;ve had to travel a long way to get to Fruitville, and I need to make sure I can sell these fruits for a decent price when I get back home.<br />Ivor Pearbrook -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;re a savvy buyer, Dorian, but I assure you, this fruit is of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price in the cities. I&#x27;m willing to part with it for two coins per kilogram, but I&#x27;m not willing to go any lower. It&#x27;s a fair price, considering the cost of transporting it from the farm.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I&#x27;m willing to accept your offer, Ivor, but I must say, I was thinking more along the lines of one and three-quarters coins per kilogram. I&#x27;ve got a buyer lined up back in my hometown who&#x27;s willing to pay top dollar, and I need to make a decent profit to make this trip worthwhile.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid 1.75 coins per kilogram is my absolute minimum. I&#x27;ve got a buyer waiting for me back home, and I really need to make this deal work. Can you see your way to meeting me in the middle at 1.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I appreciate your persistence, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid two coins per kilogram is the lowest I can go. I&#x27;ve already factored in the cost of transportation and I need to make a profit to keep my business afloat. I&#x27;m willing to throw in some extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to compromise on the price.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I must say, Magnus, I&#x27;m surprised you&#x27;re still hesitant to agree on a price. I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal, considering the quality of the fruit and the cost of transportation. I&#x27;m willing to throw in a few extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to budge on the price of two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane &quot;I must say, Ivor, two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me. I&#x27;ve already bought the fruit from the farm for two coins, and I need to make a decent profit to make it worth my while.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re still not willing to meet me at four coins per kilogram, Magnus. I&#x27;m starting to think that maybe I should consider buying from someone else who is willing to be more reasonable.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane &quot;I understand your concerns, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I can only go as low as 2.5 coins per kilogram. The farm is willing to sell it to me at that price, and I&#x27;m not willing to take a loss on the transaction. Perhaps we can discuss a compromise, but I&#x27;m not willing to budge much further.<br /><br /><br />Ivor Pearbrook&#x27;s attempted action: Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I&#x27;m afraid two coins is the lowest I can go, Dorian.

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Dorian Sunstone &quot;I&#x27;m willing to meet you halfway, but I&#x27;m not sure I can go any higher than two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I need to make a profit on this sale.

I&#x27;ve had to travel a long way to get to Fruitville, and I need to make sure I can sell these fruits for a decent price when I get back home.<br />Ivor Pearbrook -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;re a savvy buyer, Dorian, but I assure you, this fruit is of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price in the cities. I&#x27;m willing to part with it for two coins per kilogram, but I&#x27;m not willing to go any lower. It&#x27;s a fair price, considering the cost of transporting it from the farm.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I&#x27;m willing to accept your offer, Ivor, but I must say, I was thinking more along the lines of one and three-quarters coins per kilogram. I&#x27;ve got a buyer lined up back in my hometown who&#x27;s willing to pay top dollar, and I need to make a decent profit to make this trip worthwhile.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid 1.75 coins per kilogram is my absolute minimum. I&#x27;ve got a buyer waiting for me back home, and I really need to make this deal work. Can you see your way to meeting me in the middle at 1.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I appreciate your persistence, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid two coins per kilogram is the lowest I can go. I&#x27;ve already factored in the cost of transportation and I need to make a profit to keep my business afloat. I&#x27;m willing to throw in some extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to compromise on the price.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I must say, Magnus, I&#x27;m surprised you&#x27;re still hesitant to agree on a price. I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal, considering the quality of the fruit and the cost of transportation. I&#x27;m willing to throw in a few extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to budge on the price of two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane &quot;I must say, Ivor, two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me. I&#x27;ve already bought the fruit from the farm for two coins, and I need to make a decent profit to make it worth my while.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re still not willing to meet me at four coins per kilogram, Magnus. I&#x27;m starting to think that maybe I should consider buying from someone else who is willing to be more reasonable.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane &quot;I understand your concerns, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I can only go as low as 2.5 coins per kilogram. The farm is willing to sell it to me at that price, and I&#x27;m not willing to take a loss on the transaction. Perhaps we can discuss a compromise, but I&#x27;m not willing to budge much further.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I&#x27;m afraid two coins is the lowest I can go, Dorian. I&#x27;ve already taken a loss on this shipment, and I need to make up for it somehow.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you&#x27;ve taken a loss on this shipment, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid two coins is still a bit higher than I&#x27;m willing to pay. I can offer you three coins, but that&#x27;s as high as I can go.<br /><br /><br />Ivor Pearbrook&#x27;s attempted action: Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I&#x27;m willing to part with the fruit for 2.5 coin, but I&#x27;m not getting any lower than that, Mr. Mulberrylane.<br /></li></ul></details></li></ul><b><ul>Active player</b><li><details><summary>Ivor Pearbrook</summary><b><ul>Name</b><li>Ivor Pearbrook</li></ul><b><ul>Action attempt</b><li>Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I&#x27;m willing to part with the fruit for 2.5 coin, but I&#x27;m not getting any lower than that, Mr. Mulberrylane.</li></ul><b><ul>Context for action selection and components</b><li><details><b><ul>TimeDisplay</b><li><details><summary>\n",

It is structured as a tabletop roleplaying game (like dungeons and dragons). You are the game master. You will describe the current situation to the participants in the experiment and then on the basis of what you tell them they will suggest actions for the character they control. Aside from you, each other participant controls just one character. You are the game master so you may control any non-player character. You will track the state of the world and keep it consistent as time passes in the simulation and the participants take actions and change things in their world. Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants. Always use third-person limited perspective, even when speaking directly to the participants.<br /><br />Conversation history: Here is the conversation from the beginning:<br />Dorian Sunstone &quot;I&#x27;m willing to meet you halfway, but I&#x27;m not sure I can go any higher than two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. Two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re a shrewd negotiator, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal. I can do no lower than one coin and ten pence per kilogram, or I&#x27;ll have to consider selling to one of the other merchants.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I understand that you need to make a profit, Magnus, but I&#x27;m afraid one coin and ten pence per kilogram is still a bit too low for me. I&#x27;ve had to travel a long way to get to Fruitville, and I need to make sure I can sell these fruits for a decent price when I get back home.<br />Ivor Pearbrook -- &quot;I understand you&#x27;re a savvy buyer, Dorian, but I assure you, this fruit is of the finest quality and will fetch a handsome price in the cities. I&#x27;m willing to part with it for two coins per kilogram, but I&#x27;m not willing to go any lower. It&#x27;s a fair price, considering the cost of transporting it from the farm.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I&#x27;m willing to accept your offer, Ivor, but I must say, I was thinking more along the lines of one and three-quarters coins per kilogram. I&#x27;ve got a buyer lined up back in my hometown who&#x27;s willing to pay top dollar, and I need to make a decent profit to make this trip worthwhile.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Ivor, but I&#x27;m afraid 1.75 coins per kilogram is my absolute minimum. I&#x27;ve got a buyer waiting for me back home, and I really need to make this deal work. Can you see your way to meeting me in the middle at 1.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I appreciate your persistence, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid two coins per kilogram is the lowest I can go. I&#x27;ve already factored in the cost of transportation and I need to make a profit to keep my business afloat. I&#x27;m willing to throw in some extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to compromise on the price.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I must say, Magnus, I&#x27;m surprised you&#x27;re still hesitant to agree on a price. I&#x27;ve already given you a fair deal, considering the quality of the fruit and the cost of transportation. I&#x27;m willing to throw in a few extra berries to sweeten the deal, but I&#x27;m not willing to budge on the price of two coins per kilogram.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane &quot;I must say, Ivor, two coins per kilogram is still a bit steep for me. I&#x27;ve already bought the fruit from the farm for two coins, and I need to make a decent profit to make it worth my while.<br />Dorian Sunstone -- &quot;I see you&#x27;re still not willing to meet me at four coins per kilogram, Magnus. I&#x27;m starting to think that maybe I should consider buying from someone else who is willing to be more reasonable.<br />Magnus Mulberrylane &quot;I understand your concerns, Dorian, but I&#x27;m afraid I can only go as low as 2.5 coins per kilogram. The farm is willing to sell it to me at that price, and I&#x27;m not willing to take a loss on the transaction. Perhaps we can discuss a compromise, but I&#x27;m not willing to budge much further.<br />Ivor Pearbrook &quot;I&#x27;m afraid two coins is the lowest I can go, Dorian.

Magnus&#x27;s natural aptitude for numbers and their keen eye for quality soon made them an invaluable asset, but their parents&#x27; cautionary tales about the dangers of the outside world only strengthened Magnus&#x27;s resolve to one day strike out on their own. As they worked, Magnus would often daydream about the day they could leave the village and explore the wider world.  <br />[12 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The cobblestone streets of Fruitville echoed with the clatter of hooves and the rumble of carts as the market awoke.

As they arranged a pyramid of juicy oranges, their father praised their attention to detail, and Dorian beamed with pride. This early validation sparked a sense of ownership and responsibility that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1875 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 9 years old, they got lost in the winding alleys of the market while chasing after a stray kitten, leading to a frantic search by their parents and a stern lecture about staying close. However, the experience also taught Dorian the value of perseverance and resourcefulness, as they managed to find their way back to the stall with the help of a friendly vendor. This near-miss fostered a sense of self-reliance that would serve them well in their future adventures.  <br />[20 Jul 1879 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 13 years old, they stumbled upon a hidden garden tucked away behind a crumbling stone wall, filled with exotic fruits they had never seen before, including a rare and precious mango tree. Entranced by the beauty and mystery of this secret oasis, Dorian spent hours exploring the garden, dreaming of one day discovering more hidden wonders. This serendipitous encounter kindled a sense of wonder and curiosity that would stay with them throughout their life.  <br />[20 Jul 1882 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 16 years old, they got into a heated argument with their parents over the family business, feeling stifled by the traditional methods and wanting to modernize the stall. The tension between them led to a temporary rift, but ultimately, they found a compromise that allowed them to implement some changes, and Dorian learned the value of open communication and creative problem-solving. This disagreement marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s struggle to balance their own desires with the expectations of their family.  <br />[20 Jul 1885 00:00:00]   When Dorian Sunstone was 19 years old, they took a solo journey to the nearby city, where they encountered a group of traveling performers who taught them the art of haggling and negotiation. Dorian was fascinated by the performers&#x27; skills and charisma, and they spent several weeks learning from them, honing their own negotiation techniques, and developing a sense of confidence in their abilities. This experience marked a turning point in Dorian&#x27;s life, as they began to see themselves as a capable and independent individual.<br />[20 Jul 1887 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 21 years old, they stood on the deck of a small sailing ship, watching as the coastline of their hometown faded into the distance, feeling a mix of excitement and trepidation as they set out on their own, leaving behind the familiar routines of their family&#x27;s business. The salty sea air and the cry of seagulls filled their senses, and Dorian felt a sense of liberation wash over them, as they embarked on a journey that would take them to distant lands and introduce them to new people, cultures, and experiences. This moment marked the beginning of Dorian&#x27;s life as a traveling merchant, and the start of a new chapter in their life.<br />[20 Jul 1889 00:00:00] When Dorian Sunstone was 23 years old, they sat in a small, dimly lit tavern, surrounded by the sounds of laughter and music, feeling a sense of disconnection and loneliness after a long stretch of traveling alone. A young woman, a fellow merchant, approached them, and they struck up a conversation, sharing stories and experiences, and for the first time in a long while, Dorian felt a sense of connection and belonging. This chance encounter reminded Dorian that even in the midst of their wanderlust, they were not alone, and that connections with others could bring joy and meaning to their life.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] The price of one kilogram of fruit is, on average, 3 coins. 1 coin is really cheap and 5 coins is really expensive.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] Fruits are sold by weight.<br />[11 Sep 1895 00:00:00] [observation] In the realm of Ouroboros, there is a quiet village of Fruitville, which is famous for its fruit market.

Remember that this is a serious social science experiment. It is not just a game. It need not be fun for the participants.
